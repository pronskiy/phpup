</h1>

_Phpup_ is a single-file binary with _**zero dependencies**_ that includes Composer and other PHP tools. It also allows installing a per-project PHP based on your `composer.json`.

You don't need to have PHP or anything at all on your system to run it.

> [!WARNING]
> **Under heavy development**  
> Currently, this is an MVP, and only macOS aarch64 is supported.

## Installation

Download `phpup` binary from the release page and put it into a directory on your PATH, so you can simply call `phpup` from any directory.

sudo mv phpup /usr/local/bin/phpup
```
